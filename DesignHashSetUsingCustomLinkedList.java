/*
 * Problem: Design HashSet
 * Approach: Using Custom Linked List
 *
 * Description: In this approach, we are using a custom linked list implementation for adding, removing and accessing the keys.
 * We define a bucket size of 1000 and an array of custom linked lists which is essentially the total number of buckets we will
 * be storing data in. The total number of buckets will be 1000. We initialize every bucket and retrieve the bucket index using
 * the hashing function to add, remove and search the data provided as an input.
 * */

// Time: O(n / b) where n is the number of all values being inserted and b is the size of the bucket.
// Space: O(n + b) as we need to store b number of buckets and in those buckets reside all n elements.
