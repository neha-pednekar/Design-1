* Problem: Min stack
* Approach: Min Stack using two stacks. We use two stacks, one to maintain all the values being pushed and popped, and
* another to main the min elements. The min stack stores elements in pair in which first value is the min value and the
* second value is the frequency of that value to avoid repetitive push and pop operations of duplicate min values.
